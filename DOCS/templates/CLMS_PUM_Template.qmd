# How to use the CLMS Product User Manual template {.unnumbered .unlisted}

This is the Product User Manual (PUM) template. You should use it to write the PUM reports for the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service. The template provides the structure and guidelines as you develop your report.

For more information about the design and style, please refer to the "CLMS Word template CLMS_February" and the CLMS Brand Guidelines or contact the communications team at the EEA.

The PUM template is organised into a set of chapters and subchapters that may be mandatory or optional. Each section is clearly identified as either (mandatory) or (optional).

You may insert a new subchapter (not described in the current structure) if you deem it necessary.

If any of the mandatory sections of the PUM cannot be described or are not applicable, please include a statement in the corresponding section explaining the reason.

The PUM template contains the following information:

-   The structure of chapters and subchapters that must be used when editing the report.

-   Information for internal project use only that must be deleted before the product is published. This information is presented in [blue boxes]{.blue-box custom-style="blue-box-line"}.

-   Instructions (e.g. an overview of the content that should be followed when editing the section). This information is presented in [yellow boxes]{.yellow-box custom-style="yellow-box-line"} and must be deleted and replaced with your content (e.g. text, tables, figures).

-   Examples of standard text and tables for chapters or subchapters (these examples are presented in [grey boxes]{.grey-box custom-style="grey-box-line"}) that can be adapted accordingly.

For visual insets such as charts, graphs, diagrams, tables, maps and photos, follow these guidelines:

-   Assign each inset a numbered caption with a clear and descriptive title (follow the design and style instructions given in the "CLMS Word template CLMS_February").Use automatic numbering for insets, to ensure that insets are numbered sequentially in **bold** (e.g., **Figure 1**, **Table 1**).

-   In the body text, refer to the inset\'s caption number in **bold**, explaining the visual\'s content (e.g., "As shown in **Inset 1**, the data highlights the following trend..."). Always use Word's cross-reference tool for referencing insets, ensuring that references update automatically if numbers change.

A guide on best practices and principles for data visualisation, is available at the URL \"<https://data.europa.eu/apps/data-visualisation-guide/>\".

# Non-technical summary [(optional chapter)]{.yellow-box custom-style="yellow-box-line"}

:::{.yellow-box custom-style="yellow-box"}
Presents a simplified explanation of the main topics for a non-expert audience, making the information accessible and understandable to the general public by using clear language, focusing on the key points and overall significance, and avoiding technical jargon.

A well-crafted non-technical summary should effectively describe the CLMS product to both the public and researchers or users who are non-specialists in your field. To achieve this, consider the following suggestions:

1.  **Know the audience**: The goal is to make the CLMS product understandable and engaging to someone without specialized knowledge.

2.  **Be specific and clear**: Avoid vague statements and use clear and concise language that directly conveys your message.

3.  **Be clear and concise**: Use short, simple words and sentences, aiming for everyday language keeping sentences under 25 words whenever possible. This non-technical summary should not exceed one page.

4.  **Provide context**: Use concrete examples to help illustrate your points and create a vivid picture for the reader.

5.  **Use active voice**: Focus on what you are doing rather than what will be done.

6.  **Limit acronyms and abbreviations**: Avoid using them as much as possible.

7.  **Avoid technical jargon**: Steer clear of phrases common in report writing (e.g., moreover, therefore).

8.  **Create original content**: Rather than copying and pasting from the main text, use the suggested headings to organize the summary clearly and accessible to all readers.

9.  **Be concise**: Strive to maintain a length of 350--400 words, focusing on the core message.

For guidance take note of these external references:

## Known thematic overlaps of the product [(optional chapter)]{.yellow-box custom-style="yellow-box-line"}

:::{.yellow-box custom-style="yellow-box"}
Provides guidance to assist users in selecting the most appropriate dataset when thematic overlaps exist between CLMS products and known external datasets. The guidance can outline criteria for choosing the best product based on factors such as:

-   Temporal and spatial resolution

-   Data accuracy and validation
