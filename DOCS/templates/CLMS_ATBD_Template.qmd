# How to use the CLMS Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document template {.unnumbered .unlisted}

This is the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) template. You should use it to write the ATBD reports for the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service. The template provides the structure and guidelines as you develop your report.

For more information about the design and style, please refer to the "CLMS Word template CLMS_February" and the CLMS Brand Guidelines or contact the communications team at the EEA.

The ATBD template is organised into a set of chapters and subchapters that are mandatory or optional.

You may insert a new subchapter (not described in the current structure) if you deem it necessary.

If any of the mandatory sections of the ATBD cannot be described or are not applicable, please include a statement in the corresponding section explaining the reason.

The ATBD template contains the following information:

-   The structure of chapters and subchapters that must be used when editing the report.

-   Information for internal project use only that must be deleted before the product is published. This information is presented in [blue boxes]{.blue-box custom-style="blue-box-line"}.

-   Instructions (e.g. an overview of the content that should be followed when editing the section). This information is presented in [yellow boxes]{.yellow-box custom-style="yellow-box-line"} and must be deleted and replaced with your content (e.g. text, tables, figures).

-   Examples of standard text and tables for chapters or subchapters (these examples are presented in [grey boxes]{.grey-box custom-style="grey-box-line"}) that can be adapted accordingly.

For visual insets such as charts, graphs, diagrams, tables, maps and photos, follow these guidelines:

-   Assign each inset a numbered caption with a clear and descriptive title (follow the design and style instructions given in the "CLMS Word template CLMS_February").Use automatic numbering for insets, to ensure that insets are numbered sequentially in **bold** (e.g., **Figure 1**, **Table 1**).

-   In the body text, refer to the inset\'s caption number in **bold**, explaining the visual\'s content (e.g., "As shown in **Inset 1**, the data highlights the following trend..."). Always use Word's cross-reference tool for referencing insets, ensuring that references update automatically if numbers change.

-   Label all units clearly (e.g., x and y axes, legends, column headers, parts of graphs and diagrams).

-   Include the source of the data or image if you did not create it yourself.

-   Ensure that the data or image is not distorted in any way.

A guide on best practices and principles for data visualisation, is available at the URL \"<https://data.europa.eu/apps/data-visualisation-guide/>\".

# Executive summary [(mandatory chapter)]{.yellow-box custom-style="yellow-box-line"}

:::{.yellow-box custom-style="yellow-box"}
Presents an overview of the product, including purpose and main features.

An executive summary should concisely communicate the key points of the CLMS product to decision-makers and stakeholders. It should provide an overview of the CLMS, highlight the products generated, and summarize what the ATBD presents. To achieve this, consider the following suggestions:

1.  **Know the audience**: Write with executives and stakeholders in mind. Focus on what they need to know to make informed decisions and avoid unnecessary details.

2.  **Highlight key points**: Clearly summarize the most important aspects of the product, including objectives, key findings, and recommendations, being direct and to the point.

3.  **Be clear and concise**: Use straightforward language, aiming for sentences to be no longer than 20--25 words whenever possible. This executive summary should not exceed two pages.

4.  **Prioritize Information**: Lead with the most critical information and ensure that the most important details are easily accessible. Use bullet points or subheadings to break down complex information.

5.  **Use active voice**: Make your writing more engaging by using active voice. Focus on actions and outcomes, emphasizing what has been done and what is recommended.

6.  **Minimize jargon**: Use technical terms only when necessary, and ensure they are clearly explained, and avoid industry-specific jargon that might be unfamiliar to a broader audience.
